Introduction to Category Theory workshop 
==========

Exercises for my Category Theory workshop at YOW Lambda Jam 2015 in Brisbane

The exercises can be found in `src/main/scala/kenbot/yowcat`.

You can test your answers with `./sbt test`

Make sure you run ./sbt test before the workshop -- the first time it runs, it will download the internet! 

ScalaSyntaxHelp.scala explains some of the basic Scala concepts used or required by the examples, which may be of use. 

Using the Scala REPL is highly recommended for working through the exercises, and exploring solutions.

`./sbt console`
